📜 How It Works

On page load, the app detects the user's current location and fetches weather data.

Users can search for any city to see the weather details.

A dropdown menu allows switching between Celsius & Fahrenheit.

The background theme changes dynamically:

Cold Weather (< 15°C / 59°F) → Blue Theme 🌊

Moderate Weather (15-30°C / 59-86°F) → Green Theme 🌿

Hot Weather (> 30°C / 86°F) → Red Theme 🔥
